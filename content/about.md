Hi, I'm Chaoya Li, a little hacker living in Taizhou, China.

I got bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/).

I have worked for Netease and Alibaba for several years. Now I'm in a small start-up company, trying hard to make value for our customers.

I love coding, writing and music.
